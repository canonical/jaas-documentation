Contribute to this documentation
================================

Good software requires great documentation and Canonical is always looking for community members
willing to lend their writing skills to the project. Community documentation, like the page youâ€™re
reading right now, is the product of a collaborative effort between Canonical and Ubuntu community
members.

Documentation practice
----------------------

At Canonical, we have embarked on a comprehensive, long-term project to transform documentation.
Our aim is to create and maintain documentation product and practice that will represent a 
standard of excellence. We want documentation to be the best it possibly can be.

How do I contribute to this documentation?
------------------------------------------

Documentation is generated from a public GitHub repository located `here <https://github.com/canonical/jaas-documentation>`_ where
you will find instructions on how to build the documentation and also serve documentation for local testing.

We welcome all pull requests with documentation changes. To make the process easier, you will find and "Edit on GitHub" link in the
footer of every page.

For this documentation we use Sphinx and reStructuredText (reST), which is the default plain text markup language used by Sphinx.
Here are some useful resources on reStructuredText:

- `Sphinx reStructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_
- `reStructuredText style guide <https://canonical-documentation-with-sphinx-and-readthedocscom.readthedocs-hosted.com/style-guide/>`_

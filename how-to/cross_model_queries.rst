JAAS: Cross-Model Queries
=============================

Introduction
------------

In this how-to, we will perform some cross-model queries via JIMM.

Prerequisites
-------------

This feature is currently only available via the CLI. The following prerequisites are required to follow this how-to.

For this tutorial you will need the following:

- A deployed JIMM
- A controller registered with JIMM

Sending Queries
---------------
Queries run over each model that the user has available to them.

The queries are sent in jq format, and run over a string identical to the output of:

``juju status --format json``

So, if you want to practice querying model statuses, you can do it locally and expect the same to work when using JIMM's cross-model queries.

Each query response has an “errors” and “results” field, containing the resulting query responses for each model available to the current user. The errors field may return errors where the jq query string is incorrectly formatted, or something went wrong internally within JIMM.

The responses will contain an JSON array map of ``[model-uuid]:[query response JSON]``.

Example:
--------
Run the following to add test models::

     juju add-model test microk8s
     juju add-model test-2 microk8s
     juju add-model test-3 microk8s

Using jimmctl, we can query for a key that does not exist like so:

``./jimmctl query-models .noneExistentKey | jq``

And the output will look like::

     {
     "results": {
         "e0c5c2fe-c00a-4013-8e69-7a168c86365f": [
         null
         ],
         "e5f83f7a-99e0-4383-8369-431d4ddc3a43": [
         null
         ],
         "f776ca74-2e21-4af2-83a0-d90ede581c6c": [
         null
         ]
     },
     "errors": {}
     }

Next, we'll perform a valid query, searching specifically for a model by name.
Note we wrap the query in single quotes here, so that the parenthesis aren't interpreted by bash:

``./jimmctl query-models 'select(.model.name=="test-2")' | jq``

We currently have a microk8s controller registered from earlier, and as we can see, the model details for that model have been returned.::

    {
    "results": {
        "f776ca74-2e21-4af2-83a0-d90ede581c6c": [
        {
            "applications": {},
            "controller": {
            "timestamp": "12:25:28"
            },
            "machines": {},
            "model": {
            "cloud": "microk8s",
            "controller": "",
            "model-status": {
                "current": "available",
                "since": "2023-03-31 12:19:31Z"
            },
            "name": "test-2",
            "region": "localhost",
            "sla": "unsupported",
            "type": "caas",
            "version": "2.9.42"
            }
        }
        ]
    },
    "errors": {}
    }

And that's a wrap! Below, you'll find some “useful queries” that may be helpful!

Useful Queries
--------------

Below are some predefined and potentially useful queries:

- ``.applications`` - Get all applications.
- ``.model`` - Get all models.
- ``.model | select(."model-status".current=="available")`` - Get all models that are currently available.
- ``select(.applications | to_entries[] | select(.key=="traefik")) | .model`` - Return all models where they contain an application of the name “traefik”.
- ``.applications | to_entries[] | select(.key=="traefik" and .value."application-status".current=="waiting") | .value`` - Get all applications where their name is traefik and their current status is “waiting”.
- ``.applications | select(.[].units | select(. != null) | . as $charms_with_units | to_entries[] | .value as $charms_with_units | $charms_with_units.subordinates | to_entries[] | .key | match("landscape-client\/\\d+"))`` - Get all applications with a landscape-client subordinate (change app name for subordinate to get another kind).
